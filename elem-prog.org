* Preamble
A good book starts by defining the terms it uses. This book begins with precise definitions of
elementary notions in programming such as *value* and *equality*. By not relying on intuition,
the book proceeds to rigorously define and explore the foundations of generic programming
(one of the authors was a creator of the C++ Standard Template Library).

This book uses a small subset of C++, focusing on templates and generic programming. It is also
more mathematical than most books about programming.

* Chapter 1: Foundations
Programming is all about manipulating objects (e.g. 42), those objects have types (e.g. int),
and those types cluster together into similar concepts (e.g. numbers).
** Entity
*** Abstract entity
An individual thing that is eternal and unchanging. For example, the number 42.
*** Concrete entity
An individual thing that comes into existence in space and time. For example,

#+begin_src C++
int n = 42;
#+end_src

The particular concrete entity ~n~ will only exist as long as it's in scope in the program, then
it will eventually be overwritten.

** Species
*** Abstract species
Describes properties of essentially equivalent abstract entities. Types are examples of species.
*** Concrete species
Describes properties of essentially equivalent concrete entities. Types are examples of species.
** Genus
*** Abstract genus
A set of abstract species with properties in common. Examples: numbers and vector spaces are each genera (plural of genus)
*** Concrete genus
A set of concrete species with properties in common.
** Data
A *datum* is a finite string of ~0~ s and ~1~ s. Data is the plural of datum. A datum corresponding to a particular entity
is said to *represent* that entity.
** Interpretation
The [[Entity][entity]] that corresponds to a datum is the *interpretation* of that datum.
** Values
A *value* is a *datum* together with it's *interpretation*.
** Equality
Two values are *equal* if they refer to the same abstract entity. This may sound circular, but it doesn't have to be, it
reduces equality of values to equality in the mathematical theories those values model. For example, if the ~int~
type models â„¤, the integers, then we can use the definition of equality as equality of integers. Those integers are not
values in our program, they are abstract entities, so there is no circularity, it just "bottoms out" in the Platonic realm.
** Representational equality
Two values are *representationally equal* if they have identical strings of bits.
** Value type
A *value type* is a correspondence between a [[Species][species]] and a set of [[Data][data]].
** Uniquely represented
A [[Value type][value type]] is *uniquely represented* if each [[Data][datum]] corresponds to at most one [[Abstract entity][abstract entity.]]
*** Examples:
Imagine a value type as 3-bit integers that use the first bit as a sign (positive or negative) and the remaining two bits
to store the magnitude, then the set of all possible values are:

| datum | entity |
|   000 |      0 |
|   001 |      1 |
|   010 |      2 |
|   011 |      3 |
|   100 |      0 |
|   101 |     -1 |
|   110 |     -2 |
|   111 |     -3 |

Notice how ~000~ and ~100~ represent 0 and -0, which are the same abstract entity, but different strings of bits, this value
type is therefore not uniquely represented.

Now imagine a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement][twos complement]] integer type:
| datum | entity |
|   000 |      0 |
|   001 |      1 |
|   010 |      2 |
|   011 |      3 |
|   100 |      4 |
|   101 |     -3 |
|   110 |     -2 |
|   111 |     -1 |

Observe that none of the entities are the same, so this value type is uniquely represented.

** Ambiguity
A [[Value type][value type]] is *ambiguous* if there is a datum that has more than one [[Interpretation][interpretation]].
** Lemma 1.1
If a [[Value type][value type]] is [[Uniquely represented][uniquely represented]], then [[Equality][equality]] implies [[Representational equality][representational equality]].
** Lemma 1.2
If a [[Value type][value type]] is [[Ambiguity][unambiguous]], then representational equality implies equality.

* Chapter 2: Transformations and Their Orbits
an *operation* is a homogeneous function of nonzero arity

a *transformation* is a unary operation

For example, ~square~ is a transformation on ~int~

#+name: square
#+begin_src C++ :noweb yes :tangle yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :flags -std=c++14
template<typename Op>
    requires(BinaryOperation(Op))
Domain(Op) square(const Domain(Op)& x, Op op)
{
    return op(x, x);
}
#+end_src

Where we define ~Domain(.)~ using a macro. Observe that the ~requires(...)~ macro throws away everything, 
it is for documentation purposes only. /In the year 2020, the C++20 standard will provide language-level support 
for ~concepts~ and ~requires~ constraints./

#+name: headers
#+begin_src C++ :noweb yes
#define Domain(ftype) typename ftype::DomainType
#define requires(...)
#+end_src

An example of the ~ftype~ would be ~BinaryOperation~

Testing out the ~square~ template function applied to ~Op~, and then applied to 2 and 3:

#+name: ftypes
#+begin_src C++ :noweb yes
template <typename T>
struct BinaryOperation {
  typedef T DomainType;
  typedef T ReturnType;
  typedef std::function<T(T,T)> FuncType;
  FuncType fn;
  ReturnType operator()(DomainType x, DomainType y) {
    return fn(x,y);
  };
};
#+end_src

Now we tie it all together 
#+begin_src C++ :noweb yes :tangle square.cpp :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :flags -std=c++14
<<headers>>
<<ftypes>>
<<square>>

int main()
{
  BinaryOperation<int> mult;
  mult.fn = [](int a, int b) { return a * b; };

  cout << square<BinaryOperation<int>>(2, mult) << endl
       << square<BinaryOperation<int>>(3, mult) << endl
       << square<BinaryOperation<int>>(4, mult) << endl;
  return 0;
}
#+end_src
#+RESULTS:
|  4 |
|  9 |
| 16 |

** Orbits
Given a transformation $f$ and a point $x$, we define the orbit as the set $\{x, f(x), f(f(x)), ... \}$
